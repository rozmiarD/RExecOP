# Safety model

RExecOp implements **Regulated Execution Operations** — controlled, auditable workflow execution,
not unconstrained automation.

## Hard rules

1. **No apply without governance** — mutating execution requires a positive GovEngine admission
   decision and satisfied approval state.
2. **No ad hoc workflows** — only profile-declared steps may run; the workflow runner never
   invents steps.
3. **Evidence is mandatory** — state transitions and step boundaries emit internal evidence events.
4. **Secrets never in store** — passwords, tokens, and API keys are redacted from evidence;
   environment YAML must use `secret_ref` (inline secrets rejected at plan time).
5. **LLM is not an executor** — models may analyze escalation packages later; they do not bypass
   RExecOp or GovEngine.
6. **Profiles stay out of core** — no Tecrax/Ravenclaw domain logic in `src/rexecop` (CI grep).

## Connector posture

- `http_api` is generic — infrastructure APIs are environment config instances, not core code.
- `http_api` may invoke **only** capabilities declared in the profile connector contract.
- Mutating `http_api` calls require GovEngine `allowed` for the operation and apply mode.
- `local_shell_readonly` refuses `apply` / `recovery` modes; commands must be allowlisted.
- Connector responses pass through evidence redaction (including API-shaped payloads).

## GovEngine adapter posture

| Adapter | Production? |
| --- | --- |
| `GovEngineClient` | Yes — default adapter |
| `StaticGovEngineAdapter` | **No** — bootstrap and tests only |

The static adapter is documented as non-production in code, tests, and
[govengine-integration.md](govengine-integration.md).

## Operator defaults

- Default operation mode: `dry_run` (CLI default on `plan`)
- `apply` requires explicit mode selection, GovEngine clearance, and approval when required
- Escalation packages list **descriptive** safe next options — they are not auto-executed commands
- Real environment and secrets files live **outside git**; use `*.example.yaml` templates in-repo
- Target lock and queue limit concurrent mutating work per environment policy
- Maintenance windows block apply when configured

## Runtime storage

`.rexecop/` is gitignored. Operators must verify exports and evidence do not contain resolved
secrets before sharing artifacts outside the host.

## Pre-alpha limits

RExecOp is **not** production-ready software:

- No HA scheduler, daemon, or multi-tenant isolation
- File-based storage only (SQLite port defined, not default)
- Mock and staging `http_api` paths are proven; live production infra is operator responsibility
- GovEngine and SCLite remain authoritative for governance and truth — RExecOp does not replace them
